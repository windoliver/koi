# @koi/bash-ast

L0u package — AST-based bash command analysis for permission matching.

> Layered as L0u (not L2) so L2 packages like `@koi/tools-bash` can depend
> on it directly without breaking the layer rule "L2 may only import from
> L0 + L0u". Shares this layer with `@koi/bash-security`, which bash-ast
> imports for prefilter and transitional fallback.

## Purpose

Parses a raw bash command string into a trustworthy `argv[]` for each simple
command so the permissions evaluator can match on semantic structure instead of
fragile regex patterns. Answers exactly one question:

> *Can we produce a trustworthy argv[] for every simple command in this string?*

If **yes**, the caller gets a `SimpleCommand[]` with resolved argv, environment
variable assignments, and redirects. Downstream rule matching compares
`BashRulePattern` (from `@koi/core`) against each `argv`.

If **no**, the command is classified `too-complex`. Two classifiers pick up
from here, depending on whether the caller has an interactive prompt surface:

- **Sync path** (`classifyBashCommand`) — falls through to the existing
  `@koi/bash-security` regex TTP classifier as a transitional compatibility
  shim. Used by `koi start`, standalone tests, and any caller without a
  prompt surface.
- **Async path** (`classifyBashCommandWithElicit`) — calls the provided
  `elicit` callback with the command text, walker reason, and node type;
  the user decides allow/deny explicitly. Closes #1634's fail-closed loop.
  Used by the TUI (wired in `tui-runtime.ts`), where `elicit` is routed
  to the same `approvalHandler` that backs permission dialogs.

If parsing fails entirely (timeout, over-length, init failure), the result is
`parse-unavailable` and both paths **fail closed**.

## Public API

```typescript
import type { BashRulePattern } from "@koi/core/bash-rule-pattern";
import {
  initializeBashAst,
  classifyBashCommand,
  classifyBashCommandWithElicit,
  matchSimpleCommand,
  type AstAnalysis,
  type SimpleCommand,
  type Redirect,
  type ElicitCallback,
} from "@koi/bash-ast";

// One-time startup. Caches the init promise; idempotent under concurrent calls.
await initializeBashAst();

// Sync path — transitional regex fallback for non-interactive callers.
const result = classifyBashCommand("git status --porcelain");

// Async path — interactive elicit for too-complex commands.
const elicit: ElicitCallback = async ({ command, reason, nodeType }) => {
  // Surface to user via channel-level prompt.
  return userApproved(command, reason, nodeType);
};
const asyncResult = await classifyBashCommandWithElicit("for i in 1 2; do echo $i; done", {
  elicit,
});

switch (result.kind) {
  case "simple": {
    // SimpleCommand[] — argv + envVars + redirects + source text
    for (const cmd of result.commands) {
      const pattern: BashRulePattern = { argv0: "git", argsPrefix: ["status"] };
      if (matchSimpleCommand(pattern, cmd)) {
        // allow
      }
    }
    break;
  }
  case "too-complex":
    // Transitional: fall back to @koi/bash-security regex classifier.
    // After #1622: route to ask-user verdict.
    break;
  case "parse-unavailable":
    // Fail closed — init not complete, parse timeout, over-length, or panic.
    break;
}
```

## Output shape

```typescript
type AstAnalysis =
  | { kind: "simple"; commands: readonly SimpleCommand[] }
  | {
      kind: "too-complex";
      reason: string;
      nodeType?: string;
      primaryCategory: TooComplexCategory;   // required — see "Too-Complex Category Taxonomy" below
    }
  | {
      kind: "parse-unavailable";
      cause: "not-initialized" | "timeout" | "over-length" | "panic";
    };

type TooComplexCategory =
  | "scope-trackable"
  | "parameter-expansion"
  | "positional"
  | "control-flow"
  | "shell-escape"
  | "heredoc"
  | "process-substitution"
  | "parse-error"
  | "unsupported-syntax"
  | "malformed"
  | "unknown";

interface SimpleCommand {
  /** argv[0] is the command name, argv[1..] are resolved arguments. */
  readonly argv: readonly string[];
  /** Leading `VAR=val` assignments before the command name. */
  readonly envVars: readonly { readonly name: string; readonly value: string }[];
  /** Output/input redirects attached to this command. */
  readonly redirects: readonly Redirect[];
  /** Original source span for UI display and logging. */
  readonly text: string;
}
```

## Too-Complex Category Taxonomy

`AstAnalysis.too-complex.primaryCategory` is a stable closed enum that
abstracts tree-sitter grammar details. Consumers should switch on
`primaryCategory` rather than on `nodeType` — the former is versioned API,
the latter is raw parser output that can change across
`tree-sitter-bash` upgrades.

The eleven categories:

| Category | Meaning | Example input |
|---|---|---|
| `scope-trackable` | `$VAR` or `$(cmd)`. Future scope-tracking (see [#1661](https://github.com/windoliver/koi/issues/1661)) would rescue some of these. Excludes `${VAR}`. | `echo $X`, `echo $(date)` |
| `parameter-expansion` | Any `${...}` form. | `echo ${X:-def}` |
| `positional` | `$1..$9`, `$@`, `$*`, `$#`, `$?`, `$!` — and mixed forms like `$1suffix` (prefix rule). | `echo $1`, `echo "prefix$@"` |
| `control-flow` | `for`/`while`/`if`/`case`/`function`/`subshell`. | `if true; then echo hi; fi` |
| `shell-escape` | Backslash escapes in `word` or inside double-quoted strings; line-continuation prefilter. Raw source text does not match bash's effective semantics. | `cat \/etc\/passwd` |
| `heredoc` | `heredoc_redirect`. | `cat <<EOF\nhi\nEOF` |
| `process-substitution` | `<(cmd)` / `>(cmd)`. | `cat <(echo hi)` |
| `parse-error` | Tree-sitter reported `root.hasError`. Under the vendored grammar, this can also fire on some valid bash inputs. | `echo "unterminated` |
| `unsupported-syntax` | Walker encountered a recognized grammar construct it chose not to implement (arithmetic expansion, brace expansion, top-level `variable_assignment(s)`, `declaration_command`, concatenation, etc.). | `echo $(( 1 + 2 ))`, `export X=1` |
| `malformed` | Walker encountered an unexpected AST shape (missing/extra children, failed structural assertion). **Does NOT imply the source was invalid bash** — reachability is grammar-version-dependent. Treat as a diagnostic of what the walker saw. | (parser-dependent; no stable fixture) |
| `unknown` | Walker hit a statement or argument node type not in its dispatch table. Grammar-drift or walker-bug signal — if you see this in production, file an issue. | (should not fire in steady state) |

### Short-circuit caveat

The walker returns on the first blocker it encounters. A command like
`if [ -z "$X" ]; then Y=$(date); fi` gets
`primaryCategory: "control-flow"` even though it also contains a
scope-trackable subtree. Full-subtree category capture would require a
walker refactor that this PR does not undertake.

## Fail-closed invariant

The module has one non-negotiable safety property: **any grammar node type that
the walker does not explicitly allowlist causes the entire command to be
classified `too-complex`**. Unknown syntax never produces an argv. This is the
single most important test in the package, covered by:

1. **Injected fake parser** — all failure modes (null, throw, timeout,
   not-initialized) must produce `parse-unavailable` with the correct `cause`
   discriminator; no branch falls through to a permissive path.
2. **Real parser, adversarial inputs** — deep `((a[0]…` nesting,
   over-length strings, invalid UTF-8, control characters. All must produce
   `parse-unavailable` or `too-complex`.
3. **fast-check fuzz** — 1000 random inputs per run; every outcome must be one
   of the three variants and no execution path may throw.

If any of these loosen, an attacker can craft input that tree-sitter fails to
parse yet the caller still treats as a simple command. The test suite is the
only thing standing between "fail closed" and "silently permissive."

## Two-phase prefilter

Cheap byte-level checks run **before** the tree-sitter parse to reject
obviously-malicious input in microseconds:

1. **Pre-parse** (from `@koi/bash-security`):
   - Null bytes (`\x00`) and other control characters
   - URL-encoded path traversal (`%2e%2e`, `%252e%252e`)
   - Hex-escaped ANSI-C strings (`$'\x72\x6d'`)
2. **Parse** — tree-sitter-bash builds the AST (50 ms timeout, 50K node
   budget; over-budget input → `parse-unavailable` with `cause: "timeout"`).
3. **Post-parse differential** — checks that need both raw bytes and the AST
   (e.g., zsh `~[name]` dynamic directory syntax, brace+quote obfuscation).
4. **Walk** — the allowlist-based walker extracts `SimpleCommand[]` or bails
   to `too-complex`.

## Phase-1 limitations (documented; deferred to follow-ups)

- **No variable scope tracking.** Any `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, or `$(...)` inside a
  command returns `too-complex`. Patterns like `NOW=$(date) && echo $NOW`
  are not statically analyzable and currently fall back to the regex
  classifier. A follow-up issue will evaluate shipping a scope tracker if
  prompt noise proves intolerable in practice.
- **No per-command semantic specs.** `SimpleCommand` tells you *"this is `cp`
  with these args"* — not *"this reads X and writes Y"*. A follow-up issue
  will add hand-written specs for `cp, mv, rm, curl, wget, tar, scp, ssh,
  chmod` if needed.
- **No wrapper-command specs.** Commands like `nohup`, `timeout`, `sudo`,
  `env` are analyzed as themselves — not as their inner command. A follow-up
  issue will add wrapper stripping.

## `too-complex` routing — sync fallback + async elicit

Two classifiers share the same AST pipeline but differ in how they handle
`too-complex` outcomes whose nodeType is NOT a shell-escape hard-deny reason:

- **`classifyBashCommand` (sync)** — falls through to the `@koi/bash-security`
  regex TTP classifier as a transitional compatibility fallback. Preserves
  current behavior for non-interactive callers (`koi start`, standalone tool
  tests) so common shell patterns (`$VAR`, `$(cmd)`, for-loops, `&&`) do not
  force user prompts they can't respond to.

- **`classifyBashCommandWithElicit` (async)** — calls the provided `elicit`
  callback with the command text, walker reason, and node type. The user
  decides allow/deny explicitly. Used by the TUI via `tui-runtime.ts`, where
  `elicit` is routed to the same `approvalHandler` that backs permission
  dialogs. Closes #1634's fail-closed loop.

Both paths:

- Hard-deny escape-related `too-complex` cases (`word`, `string_content`,
  `prefilter:line-continuation`) — these NEVER reach the regex fallback OR
  the elicit callback because the raw source doesn't match bash's effective
  argv, so neither a regex nor a user can safely approve them.
- Run the regex TTP classifier as defense-in-depth on the `simple` path AND
  after elicit approval, so known-malicious patterns (reverse shells,
  exfiltration, privilege escalation) are blocked regardless of user
  consent.

When `classifyBashCommandWithElicit` is wired end-to-end (as in the TUI),
#1622's persistent approval memory is orthogonal future work — the user
sees the prompt immediately, and #1622's SQLite log layer (when it ships)
will decide whether to cache "always allow" across restarts.

## Testing

| Layer | What it proves |
|-------|----------------|
| Unit | Walker extracts argv/envVars/redirects correctly for each allowed node kind |
| Unit (fail-closed) | Every parser failure mode produces `parse-unavailable` |
| Integration | Adversarial real inputs (deep nesting, over-length, control chars) never produce `simple` |
| Fuzz (fast-check) | 1000 random strings; outcome always in `{simple, too-complex, parse-unavailable}`, no throws |
| Concurrent init | `Promise.all([classify(a), classify(b), classify(c)])` before init — asserts init runs exactly once |
| Bypass corpus | Every case from `@koi/bash-security/__tests__/bypass-cases.ts` mapped to expected AST outcome |

## Golden query coverage

Three golden queries in `@koi/runtime` exercise this package end-to-end:

- **`bash-exec`** (existing) — `echo hello-from-bash` reaches
  `kind: "simple"`, rule matches, command runs. Proves the happy path.
- **`bash-ast-too-complex`** — `KOI_GREETING=hello echo "$KOI_GREETING"`
  reaches `kind: "too-complex"` (simple_expansion in a double-quoted
  string), and without an elicit callback wired, falls through to the
  sync regex classifier. Proves the transitional non-interactive path.
- **`bash-ast-elicit`** — same shape but with an elicit callback wired
  (auto-approving in the cassette recording). Proves the async path:
  `classifyBashCommandWithElicit` is invoked, the elicit callback
  receives the command + reason + nodeType, the user approves, the
  regex TTP defense-in-depth still runs, and the command spawns.
  Closes #1634's fail-closed loop.

## WASM asset delivery

The tree-sitter-bash grammar is committed as a binary asset at
`packages/lib/bash-ast/vendor/tree-sitter-bash.wasm` (~1.3 MB) and loaded at
runtime via `new URL("../vendor/tree-sitter-bash.wasm", import.meta.url)`.
`tsup` copies the vendor directory into `dist/` at build time. The file is
refreshed by a one-time script that extracts it from
`@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm` (devDependency only).

Rebuilding the grammar file:

```sh
bun run packages/lib/bash-ast/scripts/refresh-grammar.ts
```
